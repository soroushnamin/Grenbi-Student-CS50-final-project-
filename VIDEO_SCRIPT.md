[0:15 — 0:45] What it is
Grenbi Lite is a minimal, plant‑based meal recommendation web app.
It suggests vegetarian and vegan recipes based on a user’s diet, goal, cuisine preference, and exclusions.
It’s a simplified version of my startup concept, focusing on core CS50 skills in Python, Flask, and basic data handling.

[0:45 — 2:15] Demo
Open the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000
Select Diet = Vegan, Goal = Weight Loss, Cuisine = Turkish.
Type “gluten” in Exclude to filter out bulgur.
Click “Find Recipes” and show the results. Explain calories, protein, fiber, and the score.
Change Goal to Muscle Gain and show how the ranking changes.
Optionally show another cuisine (Indian) and explain filters.

[2:15 — 2:45] How it works (brief)
Flask handles routing and form submissions.
Pandas filters a small CSV dataset.
A simple scoring function prioritizes calories, protein, and fiber based on the selected goal.
HTML/CSS render a clean UI. The dataset and scoring can be extended later.
